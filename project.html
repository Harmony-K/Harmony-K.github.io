            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A website specifically designed for people who want to give D&D a shot. To be clear, it doesn't aim to teach people how to play D&D, but will aid with the creation of simple characters which ultimately make learning the game much easier. The best way to learn is by playing.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, It also aims to aid with gameplay - it’s easier to start off playing D&D with a more basic character so that a newbie can get used to the mechanics. Thus, specific classes and races will be available.</p>
            <p>This website is being designed as a tool for beginners. Players who find that they are comfortable with the gameplay are encouraged to use another app or site that is more advanced (there are SO MANY out there and they have way more cool stuff). The site will also provide FAQs and other various tools/popups implemented throughout the site.
            </p>
            <p>Once again, there are a lot of sites where you can create a character in no time, and for players who know the system and how things work, this is super useful and efficient to use. However, for beginners it’s a different story. Ultimately, this site will streamline and simplify the character creation process and make the concepts of the game easier to grasp.</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>If you’ve ever played D&D, you know that creating a character from scratch takes time, and if I’m being honest, it discourages a lot of new players. Look, the character creation process can be a lot of fun. However, if it's your first time playing, there is a lot to take in. Some people get overwhelmed by the amount of content there is available and it can be quite intimidating. This is where a lot of people lose interest and give up.</p>
            <p>Ok so let’s say you've made a character, but you don't know how to play. And on top of that, the character sheet is hard to read. AND you have too many things to keep track of. These are prime examples of why people never end up playing the D&D. Hopefully, this website will help remedy these problems and we can get more people playing the game and having fun with friends (and, hopefully, making friends too!).</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A website seems like the best option for now. Rather than an app, the website will be available to more people (not restricted to a certain OS) as it can be accessed through various devices.</p>
            <p>The website will consist of four pages; character creation, character sheet desktop / game mode, a mobile phone character sheet / game mode and a ? page (for FAQs). It will be recommended that the character creation is to be done on a desktop though. Maybe in the future, this project can develop into a responsive website.
            </p>
            <p>The reasoning behind the separate pages for editing and “game mode” is that there is nothing worse than trying to perform a task and then accidentally deleting or editing something important. Making a webpage specifically for a mobile phone just makes accessing and viewing “character sheets” easier. It will have all the same content as the desktop view, but will have buttons with headings separating content and, once clicked, will show the relevant content.
            </p>
            <p>As this website aims to help beginners, only levels 1-5 for the main classes in 5e Dungeons and Dragons will be available. While it might seem like it will exclude a lot of  ”cool” options the game has to offer, ultimately, it will benefit the user when first learning how to play.
            </p>
            <h3>Character Creation Page</h3>
            <p>This page will consist of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Drop-down boxes for</strong> race → class → background → these elements will all be auto-filled in once selected.  </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Options that need to be selected will have separate dropdowns options available.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Ability scores and hit points:                 </li>
                <li>Bio / Personality traits / Appearance </li>
                <li>Feats</li>
                <li>Spells</li>
                <li>Equipment</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is needed?  </h2>
            <p>From the research that I’ve done and from conversations with a friend, as far as I know, the resources needed include:</p>
            <Ul>
                <li>A computer - With access to the internet. To run the software needed, write the code and run the website.</li>
                <li>Github - To host the website and be able to work effectively in a team. 
                </li>
                <li>Visual Studio Code  - Makes life easier when writing code and accessing/organising files. 
                </li>
                <li>Node.js  - to read and run React.js and styled-components,  so the website can be interactive. 
                </li>
            </Ul>
            <p>The skills required for this project include; the ability to write in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and use GitHub correctly. All the software listed above are open source. As classes are online, it would be safe to assume everyone has access to a computer and the internet, and that we have just learnt HTML and CSS. As such, the project seems very feasible.
            </p>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>Hopefully, we get more people playing D&D, having fun and making memories. The character creation will become super easy and efficient, and the simplified character sheets will help beginners continue playing. The learning curve is lowered, but there is still some customisation that allows for a more in-depth character to be built. </p>
            <p>To sum it up, the website simplifies the character creation phase and makes accessing the content you need from the character sheet easier. From there, once players are comfortable and used to gameplay, they can move onto other applications and websites with more advanced features and content.

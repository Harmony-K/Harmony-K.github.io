                   <p>Let me preface this part of the assignment by saying that I have no idea what my ideal job is, which is why I'm taking this program. So if I end up liking certain topics, the plan is to explore them further.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="project-first-col">
                    <p>However, for the sake of completing this assignment, I've chosen something that intrigues me.  Initially, while I was scrolling through seek.com.au, I was looking for front end developing jobs (I found myself enjoying the process of developing after putting together the bulk of this website) and I found two listings that stood out.</p>

                    <p>(SEEK, 2021)</p>
                    <p>I was drawn to this advertisement as it is health-related which is still very important to me. Although Iâ€™m not currently pursuing a career in the field I am a strong advocate of good health.

                    <p>(SEEK, 2021)</p>
                    <p>This advertisement sparked my interest because before I really started to look into realistic jobs that were available, I wanted to do something that incorporated both the designing and creation of user interfaces. I realised that despite these being two separate elements (design and development), this job listing made me realise that skills from both departments can be incorporated into one job.

                <p style="text-align: left; margin: 10px 300px;">If I'm being honest, I would have liked to have looked into the business and find out more about it. The fusion of the two elements of design and development was the deciding factor of me choosing this as an "ideal job".</p>

                        <h2>What is required?</h2>
                           <p>Considerable UI and UX design skills for mobile and app design alongside notable computer skills and qualifications in UI or Graphic Design.</p>
                           <p>Proficiency with HTML/CSS (SASS/LESS), a great advantage would be having knowledge in JavaScript/TypeScript and proficient with source control tools and project management.</p>
                           <p>A portfolio showcasing these skills and at least 3 years of experience designing mobile web or apps.       </p>
                           <p>Exceptional English language communication skills (spoken and written English).</p>

                           <h2>Am I qualified?</h2>
                           <p>No, the only part that I might tick off is having some skills in HTML and CSS (this website) but even then, I've only just learnt the basics.    </p>

                            <h2>What steps should I take to obtain the requirements?</h2>
                            <p>I was planning on taking the short course UX + UI Design also offered at RMIT to see if I preferred designing over creating and naturally, this would help tick off a few more requirements.</p>
                            <p>I would probably do a bachelors in IT or Design (majoring and minoring in the relevant fields) depending on which area I like the most. Then, during my study, create more websites and or apps to help build my portfolio.</p>
                            <p>After graduating, I aim to get a job in either web design or development and continue building up more experience in the relevant fields.</p>

                   <h2>My childhood to now...</h2>
                   <p> I’ve always liked playing video games. As a kid being the eldest (out of three) and most competitive I inevitably was “the best” (although my siblings would say otherwise) at every game we played, and I guess you could say this is where my love for multiplayer video games began. Throughout the years, I’ve made lifelong friends from playing video games (on the PC) with “just some kids from school''. In more recent years, we found a new addition to the group. It was this addition who introduced us to a game that would forever change me. This game is called Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
                   <p>In my later teen years to now, I’ve “built” (put the parts together) my current desktop PC, and, quite recently with my brother, put together the keyboard shown below. I still play video games with friends online, though not as much as I used to (growing up sucks). As of lately (thanks to this program), I have been learning a lot more about technology, and it really puts things into perspective for me. For example, now I know more about the various areas of IT and what they might entail, and more about how “things” work, which has been quite refreshing for me.

                    <h2>The event that sparked my pursuit of IT...</h2>
                    <p> Let me be honest though, the event that sparked my interest in the possibility of pursuing a career in IT was my coworker. He’d just finished his bachelors in IT this year and was talking about the new job that he had lined up for next year. </p>
                    <p>At the time I was pretty lost. I had been out of university for a few months and didn’t know what I was going to do, but the way he was talking about IT and answering my questions got me thinking that IT could be a possibility for me. I’d also had conversations with another friend of mine (current software developer) and my younger brother (currently studying IT too) which was enough to push me over the edge. And so, I decided to give it a go.</p>

                    <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
                    <p>RMIT provides the best and easiest solution. This program lets me test the waters, and not only that, but even if I don’t feel like it's something for me, I still get a certificate out of it (it’s a win-win!). On top of that, since I had previously studied at RMIT, I know how to use canvas and access all the things I need.</p>

                    <h2>What I hope to get out of the program</h2>
                    <p>Upon further reflection, I realised that one of the reasons why I chose this program is very similar to why I chose to do the previous program I was in. I wanted to know how things worked.</p>
                    <p><em>How do all our systems work together so that we can be functioning humans?<strong> VS </strong> How do all these components (hardware) come together and communicate with each other to create a computer?</em></p>
                    <p><em>How can we aid with the healing process? What went wrong? How do you prevent this? Can you prevent it? <strong> VS </strong> How do I fix this? Where is the initial problem even coming from?</em></p>
                    <p>Thus, hopefully after this program, I’ll have some of these questions answered and get a better sense of the absolute basics of IT, see if something sticks, and go from there.</p>
